# Iris Flower Classification üå∏

This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into their respective species using machine learning techniques. I used the popular Iris dataset which includes sepal and petal measurements to predict the species.

## Objective

The main goal of this task was to analyze the Iris dataset and build a classification model that accurately predicts the species of the flower.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 150 rows and 5 columns:

- `sepal_length`
- `sepal_width`
- `petal_length`
- `petal_width`
- `species` (target variable)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I performed EDA to understand the data distribution and relationships:
- Checked for null values
- Visualized data using pair plots and heatmaps
- Verified class balance

## Model Used

I chose the Random Forest Classifier for its performance and simplicity. It provided excellent accuracy on both training and test sets.

## Steps Followed

1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Checked for missing values
3. Visualized data with seaborn
4. Split the data into train and test sets
5. Trained a Random Forest Classifier
6. Evaluated model accuracy

## Accuracy
- Training Accuracy: ~100%
- Test Accuracy: ~97%

## Conclusion
I successfully built a model to classify iris flowers with high accuracy. This project helped me practice data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.
